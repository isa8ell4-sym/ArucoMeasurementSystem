#This program calculates the distortion parameters of a GoPro camera.
#A video must first be taken of a chessboard pattern moved to a variety of positions
#in the field of view with a GoPro.

filename = 'C:/Users/irosenstein/Documents/Vision/Projects/Calibration/eminentCodfish/output.mp4'
#Input the number of board images to use for calibration (recommended: ~20)

#The ImageCollect function requires two input parameters.  Filename is the name of the file
#in which checkerboard images will be collected from.  n_boards is the number of images of
#the checkerboard which are needed.  In the current writing of this function an additional 5
#images will be taken.  This ensures that the processing step has the correct number of images
#and can skip an image if the program has problems.

#This function loads the video file into a data space called video.  It then collects various
#meta-data about the file for later inputs.  The function then enters a loop in which it loops
#through each image, displays the image and waits for a fixed amount of time before displaying
#the next image.  The playback speed can be adjusted in the waitKey command.  During the loop
#checkerboard images can be collected by pressing the spacebar.  Each image will be saved as a
#*.png into the directory which stores this file.  The ESC key will terminate the function.
#The function will end once the correct number of images are collected or the video ends.
#For the processing step, try to collect all the images before the video ends.

#The ImageProcessing function performs the calibration of the camera based on the images
#collected during ImageCollect function.  This function will look for the images in the folder
#which contains this file.  The function inputs are the number of boards which will be used for
#calibration (n_boards), the number of squares on the checkerboard (board_w, board_h) as
#determined by the inside points (i.e. where the black squares touch).  board_dim is the actual
#size of the square, this should be an integer.  It is assumed that the checkerboard squares are
#square.

#This function first initializes a series of variables. Opts will store the true object points
#(i.e. checkerboard points).  Ipts will store the points as determined by the calibration images.
#The function then loops through each image.  Each image is converted to grayscale, and the
#checkerboard corners are located.  If it is successful at finding the correct number of corners
#then the true points and the measured points are stored into opts and ipts, respectively. The
#image with the checkerboard points are then displays.  If the points are not found that image
#is skipped.  Once the desired number of checkerboard points are acquired the calibration
#parameters (intrinsic matrix and distortion coefficients) are calculated.

#The distortion parameter are saved into a numpy file (calibration_data.npz).  The total
#total reprojection error is calculated by comparing the "true" checkerboard points to the
#image measured points once the image is undistorted.  The total reprojection error should be
#close to zero.

#Finally the function will go through the calbration images and display the undistorted image.
